I have been looking into different ways of controlling home lighting, so that
lights can be turned on and off using a computer interface, enabling lights to
be turned on at sunset, using some kind of remote control, or using voice. 
However, I am also keen to ensure that lights can still be turned on and off 
using a light switch, as normal, even if part of the system fails.

![RS Pro Logic 110v-240v no LCD]({{ "images/0001-marmitek-ad10.jpg" | absolute_url }})

The first home automation system I tried was [X10].  I had a [Marmitek AD10]
connected to the landing lights. What was great about this is that it worked 
really well with the existing home lighting wiring. It had two 
control inputs:

- Input 1 responds to a change of state, so can be used with a normal light
  switch (switching the circuit on or off will toggle the light).
- Input 2 toggles between on/off when it receives a pulse - so can be used
  with a retractive switch (that springs back like a doorbell).

Sadly there are a couple of reasons why I stopped using [X10]:
1. The main reason is that while the system worked fine for a few months, some
   kind of power line interference meant that it stopped working reliably.
2. The modules seemed to have a short life expectancy and I had a couple
   completely stop working. Replacing them got expensive.
3. As is typical of X10, the module only responds to commands and does not
   broadcast its status. This means that if someone operates the switch, it is
   not possible for a computer to know if the lights are currently on or off.


RS Pro Logic
------------

I have been aware of the [Modbus] control protocol for a while but never tried
it out partly due expense. It is typically used in industrial control and
automation applications to control [Programmable Logic Controllers].
At its most basic, it allows you to send messages to multiple devices connected
to a serial port bus, switching on and off outputs and reading inputs.

While searching the RS website, I found they had an own-brand range of
[Programmable Logic Controllers] that support the Modbus protocol, under the 
brand name [RS Pro Logic].

![RS Pro Logic 110v-240v no LCD]({{ "images/0001-rs-pro-logic.jpg" | absolute_url }})

There are four different versions of the RS Pro Logic available:

* [12v-24v with LCD](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/logic-modules/9176370/) (£78.97)
* [110v-240v with LCD](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/logic-modules/9176370/) (£78.97)
* [12v-24v no LCD](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/logic-modules/9176377/) (£62.86)
* [110v-240v no LCD](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/logic-modules/9176373/) (£62.86)
* [USB Adaptor](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/plc-accessories/9176395/) (£13.79)

(Prices correct at time of publishing)

There are also expansion modules (extra IO), RS-485 adaptors and memory cards
available in the range.

While not cheap, they are cheaper than I was expecting. And while you can only
control a single output with the X10 module, you can control 4 outputs with the
RS Pro Logic module.

There is surprisingly little documentation about the RS Pro Logic module on the
RS website. All they provide is a datasheet and software download. When I asked
for a manual, they sent me a copy of the manual for the [Genie NX] - so it is
clearly a re-branded / white-label version of that.

Apart from the supplier, there isn't a lot of information about the [Genie
NX] on the Internet either, although Mark Empson of [smart-relay.co.nz](http://www.smart-relay.co.nz)
has done some [YouTube Videos](http://www.smart-relay.co.nz/g-soft%20programming.php)
about programming them using the Windows control software.


Getting Set Up
--------------

I decided to buy the '110v-240v with no LCD' version of the module. I liked the
idea of keeping the mains voltages contained within a properly designed 
enclosure and keeping those mains voltages away from anything I was making 
myself or connecting to a computer. Because it takes in 230v in, it also doesn't 
need a separate power supply. As it was going to be hidden away somewhere
I didn't see the need for an LCD and it brought the price down a bit.

To test the [RS Pro Logic] module, I built a test rig, with one input 
(a retractive switch) and one output (a 13-amp socket).

![My Test Rig]({{ "images/0001-test-rig.jpg" | absolute_url }})

By default, the module does nothing when you first switch it on (apart from 
responding to Modbus commands). In order to do anything autonomously then you 
need to programme it using the free [RS Logic Pro Windows Software]. 

As a non-Windows User, this was a major detractor to buying an RS Logic Pro.
However, using a Windows 7 Virtual Machine from [modern.ie] and running it on 
the free [VirtualBox] hypervisor, I was able to install the software easily.

The screenshot above demonstrations one of the simplest configurations it is
possible to set up - `I1` (Input 1) is connected to `Q1` (Output 1), so as
`I1` is turned on and off, `Q1` will be turned on and off.


Performing state toggle
-----------------------

Switching an output *high* when an input is *high* is very straightforward, but
I found setting up an input to toggle an output a bit more complex:

![Toggle Configuration Screenshot]({{ "images/0001-screenshot-toggle.png" | absolute_url }})

This is a description of each of the 4 rows in the ladder:

1. `I1` (Input 1) is connected to `T1` (Timer 1), which is in configured in a
   0.1s 'Single Pulse' - Mode C. This means that however long the input button 
   is pressed, `T1` will only emit a 100ms pulse.
2. The current state of `Q1` (Output Relay 1) is connected to `T2`. 
   `T2` is in 'Single On/Off' - Mode M. This delays the current state of the 
   relay by 500ms.
3. Row 3 checks for a pulse from `T1`. If `T1` is *high* and the former state
   of the relay (`T2`) is *low*, then it sets the relay to *high*.
4. Row 4 does the opposite. If `T1` is *high* and the former state of
   the relay is *high*, then it sets the relay to *low*.

The reason for the timers is because the module behaves like electronic 
logic gates, rather than executing a sequence of commands, as software would.
So setting `Q1` to the inverse of `Q1` results in nothing happening, rather 
than rapidly turning it on and off.

This solution seems a little over-complex for the simplicity of the problem.
Please let me know if you there is a better way of doing this.
